Polire
------

The word "interpolation" has Latin origin and is composed of two words - Inter meaning between and Polire meaning to polish.

This repository is a collection of several spatial interpolation algorithm along with various sensor placement algorithms.

abstract = {Sensing is central to the SenSys and related communities. However, fine-grained spatial sensing remains a challenge despite recent advancements, owing to cost, maintenance, among other factors. Thus, estimating the sensed phenomenon at unmonitored locations and strategically installing sensors is of prime importance. In this work, we introduce Polire - an open-source tool that provides a suite of algorithms for spatial interpolation and near-field passive sensor placements. We replicate two existing papers on these two tasks to show the efficacy of Polire. We believe that Polire is an essential step towards lowering entry barriers towards sensing and scientific reproducibility.},
